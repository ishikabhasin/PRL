# Literature review

1. The Risk and Return of Venture Capital
   Source: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8066/w8066.pdf
   Notes (Charles): Old (2001), but one of the most cited papers in VC research. Look out for any discussion of return characteristics (expected return and std. dev.)
2. Factor Contributing To Independent Venture Capital Successful Exits
   Source: https://clutejournals.com/index.php/JBER/article/view/9074
   Notes (Charles): In the abstract, the author specifically mentions looking at “exits that are independent of fund inflows” and “financial and market forecasts that appear to trump market conditions”. Take notes on both of these factors, as they will inform our “money-out” statistic (prediction of VC exits / returns),
3. Venture Capital and its Role in Strategic Asset Allocation
   Source: https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijpormgmt/28/2/83
   Notes (Charles): This paper will be relevant for informing our “money–out” statistic. Look out for discussion of allocation rates depending on the investors risk tolerance. We can use that to predict allocation rates in the future.
4. Investment Risk Allocation and the Venture Capital Exit Market
   Source: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Investment-Risk-Allocation-and-the-Venture-Capital-Chaplinsky-Gupta-Mukherjee/e18d5a2226ed4bd2b99dc5c8fab2a9f1b6af0c6e
   Notes (Charles): Similar to the 2nd paper, look out for discussion of exogenous factors affecting company exits, both in terms of probability and size of exit.
5. The Decline in Venture-Backed IPOs: Implications for Capital Recovery
   Source: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Decline-in-Venture-Backed-IPOs%3A-Implications-Chaplinsky-Gupta-Mukherjee/d22d0fbc309db8eb273544d60428d14002f937b9
   Notes (Charles): Similar to papers two and four. Use to infom
6. CapitalVC: A Machine Learning Model for Startup Selection and Exit Prediction
   Source: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3684185
   Notes (Charles): This paper is focused on predicting specific companies, so it won’t be entirely relevant for us since we’re trying to predict exits/returns of the entire asset class. But their ML methodologies could be insightful for us.
