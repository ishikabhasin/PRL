### **Housing Project Overview**

The PRL Housing Project supports the joint research efforts of Professors Twite, Titman and Bialkowski, whose working paper discusses the determinants of Prime Rents. 

Previously, PRL researchers conducted a trend analysis on various housing datasets while exploring key demographic variables and utilizing time series comparisons. Researchers are presently attempting to combine housing datasets and incorporate additional variables, as needed.
