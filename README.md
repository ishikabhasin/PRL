# The Policy Research Laboratory (PRL)

Research projects are divided into four silos: Meta-Analysis, Political Economy, Health Policy, and Emerging Tech/AI.  

Meta-Analysis: This silo focuses on assessing the robustness of the findings of other papers by testing for criteria such as p-hacking and replicability. It currently focuses on its replication project, replicating the key results of over 200 papers, to test their key findings.
